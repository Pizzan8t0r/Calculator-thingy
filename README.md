# Calculator-thingy
A calculator app that has both light and dark themes, i included a tiny github button to redirect you to this github page just for fun.
Unlike the 90's this calculator isn't solar powered, but does have a tiny sun indicator to let users know about the light and dark themes attributed to it.
